KNOWN ISSUES/LIMITATIONS:
-------------------------

* Timestamps are recorded at microsecond granularity. Picosecond
  timestamps as described in the implemented C-DNS draft are not supported.

* Malformed packet recording as described in the implemented C-DNS draft
  is not supported. However, the compactor can record malformed
  packets in a separate PCAP file with the `--ignored-pcap` option.

* File rotation period reported by the inspector is calculated as the
  difference in seconds between the first and last items read from the
  C-DNS file. File rotation is an implementation detail of the compactor,
  and as such is not recorded in the C-DNS format.

* Packet loss under Ubuntu Trusty/Debian Jessie. When capturing live data
  from network interfaces, the first packet and any subsequent packet that
  arrives more than about 50ms later than its predecessor will not be
  captured. This is a problem with the libpcap library and the kernel.
  Debian Jessie can be used by updating the kernel to a later backported
  kernel; we have tested this with the 4.7.0 kernel. For Ubuntu we
  recommend upgrading to Xenial.
