==== Query/response matching

*-q, --query-timeout* _SECONDS_::
  If no response is found for a query after _SECONDS_, time out the query. The default
  timeout is 5 seconds.

*-k, --skew-timeout* _MICROSECONDS_::
  Due to the vagaries of the network stack, it is possible for responses to be reported
  before the matching query, even though the query has an earlier timestamp than
  the response. A response is not considered to be missing a query until
  after _MICROSECONDS_. The default  timeout is 10 microseconds.
