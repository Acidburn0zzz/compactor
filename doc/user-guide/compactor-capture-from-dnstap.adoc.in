If *compactor* has been built with DNSTAP enabled, the following options control capture
from DNSTAP.

*--dnstap-socket* _arg_::
  Capture DNSTAP traffic from Unix socket _arg_.

*--dnstap* [_arg_]::
  When reading input data from file, treat the data as DNSTAP data not PCAP data
  if _arg_ is `true` or `1`. The default is `false`.

*--dnstap-socket-owner* _arg_::
  If specified, *compactor* will try to set the owner of the DNSTAP socket to _arg_.

*--dnstap-socket-group* _arg_::
  If specified, *compactor* will try to set the group of the DNSTAP socket to _arg_.

*--dnstap-socket-write* _arg_::
  If specified, *compactor* will try to set write permissions on the DNSTAP socket.
  If _arg_ is `owner`, the socket owner will have write permission.
  If _arg_ is `group`, the socket owner and group will have write permission.
  If _arg_ is `all`, all users will have write permission.
  No other values of _arg_ are permitted.
